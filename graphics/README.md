graphics
========

This folder contains an SVG (vector) file that you can load into Inkscape. The
file contains four variants of the logo with colour and lettering.

There is also a script that builds PNG (bitmap) graphics. These can be
loaded into web pages, word processing documents etc. They are generated
at different pixel widths by the `build.sh` script. If you have `inkscape`
you can use it to generate PNG files at any width or height from the command
line.

The PNG files have transparent backgrounds, but should only be used on white
or very pale coloured backgrounds.
