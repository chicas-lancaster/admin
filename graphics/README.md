graphics
========

This folder contains an SVG (vector) file that you can load into Inkscape. The
file contains four variants of the logo with colour and lettering.

There is also a script that builds PNG (bitmap) graphics. These can be
loaded into web pages, word processing documents etc. They are generated
at different DPI sizes based on a 2-inch high logo - so a file with a
500 in the name will be 1000 pixels high.
